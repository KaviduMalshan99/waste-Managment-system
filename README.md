# Waste Management System

## Overview
The Waste Management System is a comprehensive platform designed to optimize waste collection, improve data-driven decision-making, and provide real-time insights for urban waste management. The updated system integrates innovative features like dynamic waste model selection, advanced data analysis tools, and enhanced user interaction. By leveraging IoT, AI, and efficient route optimization, this system aims to promote sustainability, reduce costs, and enhance operational efficiency.
